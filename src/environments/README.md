# Build Environments

Build Environments are intended to build for different environments.

    Provided Build Environments added are:

    environment.ts - Uses while running angular locally.
    Dev - Intended to build for DEV Server Environment.
    Int - Intended to build for INT Server Environment.
    Prod - Intended to build for Production Setup.

PS: Build environments are supposed to supply config according to intended server environment while building.
And this is different from environments you can find in proxy config.
